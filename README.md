# Chibobo-s-Text-Macro-Extension
This is a Chrome based extension for you to set text macros.
## Purpose
I created this to save time when filling in forms.

This will allow you to set a key on your keyboard that will paste the set text you want.
For instance: When I click the "`" key, it will paste my email address.
You can also use the function keys (F1 - F12).
