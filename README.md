# Chibobo-s-Text-Macro-Extension
This is a Chrome based extension for you to set text macros.

## Purpose
I created this to save time when filling in forms.

This will allow you to set a key on your keyboard that will paste the chosen text you want.
For instance: When I click the "`" key, it will paste my email address.
You can also use the function keys (F1 - F12).

## How to load the extension in Chrome:
1. Download the Files all into one folder
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable "Developer mode" and click on "Load unpacked".
4. Select the folder containing these files.

When using the extension, make sure to scroll down and click save. Refresh the page.
And it should be good to go.
